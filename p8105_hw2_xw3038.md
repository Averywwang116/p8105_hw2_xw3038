## Problem 1

Load the necessary packages for this assignment

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
```

Read and clean the data; retain line, station, name, station latitude /
longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA
compliance. Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a
logical variable (the ifelse or case_match function may be useful).

``` r
#load the data using relative path
NYC_subway=read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
                    col_types = cols(Route8 =col_character(), 
                                     Route9 = col_character(), 
                                     Route10 =col_character(), 
                                     Route11 = col_character())) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(line:exit_only,vending,ada) |>
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
head(NYC_subway,5)
## # A tibble: 5 × 20

##   <chr>    <chr>                   <dbl>             <dbl> <chr>  <chr>  <chr>

## 2 4 Avenue 25th St                  40.7             -74.0 R      <NA>   <NA>  
## 3 4 Avenue 36th St                  40.7             -74.0 N      R      <NA>  
## 4 4 Avenue 36th St                  40.7             -74.0 N      R      <NA>  
## 5 4 Avenue 36th St                  40.7             -74.0 N      R      <NA>  
## # ℹ 13 more variables: route4 <chr>, route5 <chr>, route6 <chr>, route7 <chr>,
## #   route8 <chr>, route9 <chr>, route10 <chr>, route11 <chr>,
## #   entrance_type <chr>, entry <lgl>, exit_only <chr>, vending <chr>, ada <lgl>
```

The variables include: Line, station name, station latitude and
longtitude, route 1 to 11, entrance type, entry, exit_only and ada
information.

The first step is to convert the Route8 to 11 into character type so
that all the types of Route are now consistent. Then the
`janitor::clean_names()` is used to standardize the column names. And
specific columns according to the instruction are selected. Then the
entry variable is converted to the logical variable using ifelse. The
cleaned dataset now has 1868 rows and 20 columns. And these data are not
tidy as we should convert `route` variables from wide to long format.

``` r
filter_station=select(NYC_subway,line,station_name,ada,entry,vending)
```

- There are 465 distinct stations

- There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant

``` r
# Filter for stations without vending machines
without_vending=nrow( filter_station |>
  filter(vending == "NO") )

# Calculate the proportion of entrances without vending machines that allow entry
noentry_without_vending=nrow( filter_station |>
  filter(vending == "NO" & entry=="TRUE") )
```

The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance is 0.3770492

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables.

``` r
reformat_df=
  NYC_subway |>
  mutate(across(starts_with("route"), as.character)) |>
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11, 
    names_to = "route_number", 
    values_to = "route_name", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
    )
```

``` r
A_station=reformat_df|>filter(route_name == "A")|>distinct(line,station_name)
A_train_ada= reformat_df|>filter(route_name == "A"& ada=="TRUE")|>distinct(line,station_name)
```

- There are 60 distinct stations served the A train.
- There are 17 distinct A stations that are ADA compliant
