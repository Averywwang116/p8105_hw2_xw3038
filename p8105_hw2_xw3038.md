## Problem 1

Load the necessary packages for this assignment

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
```

Read and clean the data; retain line, station, name, station latitude /
longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA
compliance. Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a
logical variable (the ifelse or case_match function may be useful).

``` r
#load the data using relative path
NYC_subway=read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
                    col_types = cols(Route8 =col_character(), 
                                     Route9 = col_character(), 
                                     Route10 =col_character(), 
                                     Route11 = col_character())) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(line:exit_only,vending,ada) |>
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
head(NYC_subway,5)
## # A tibble: 5 × 20
##   line     station_name station_latitude station_longitude route1 route2 route3
##   <chr>    <chr>                   <dbl>             <dbl> <chr>  <chr>  <chr> 
## 1 4 Avenue 25th St                  40.7             -74.0 R      <NA>   <NA>  
## 2 4 Avenue 25th St                  40.7             -74.0 R      <NA>   <NA>  
## 3 4 Avenue 36th St                  40.7             -74.0 N      R      <NA>  
## 4 4 Avenue 36th St                  40.7             -74.0 N      R      <NA>  
## 5 4 Avenue 36th St                  40.7             -74.0 N      R      <NA>  
## # ℹ 13 more variables: route4 <chr>, route5 <chr>, route6 <chr>, route7 <chr>,
## #   route8 <chr>, route9 <chr>, route10 <chr>, route11 <chr>,
## #   entrance_type <chr>, entry <lgl>, exit_only <chr>, vending <chr>, ada <lgl>
```

The variables include: Line, station name, station latitude and
longtitude, route 1 to 11, entrance type, entry, exit_only and ada
information.

The first step is to convert the Route8 to 11 into character type so
that all the types of Route are now consistent. Then the
`janitor::clean_names()` is used to standardize the column names. And
specific columns according to the instruction are selected. Then the
entry variable is converted to the logical variable using ifelse. The
cleaned dataset now has 1868 rows and 20 columns. And these data are not
tidy as we should convert `route` variables from wide to long format.

``` r
filter_station=select(NYC_subway,line,station_name,ada,entry,vending)
```

- There are 465 distinct stations

- There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant

``` r
# Filter for stations without vending machines
without_vending=nrow( filter_station |>
  filter(vending == "NO") )

# Calculate the proportion of entrances without vending machines that allow entry
noentry_without_vending=nrow( filter_station |>
  filter(vending == "NO" & entry=="TRUE") )
```

\*The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance is 0.3770492

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables.

``` r
reformat_df=
  NYC_subway |>
  mutate(across(starts_with("route"), as.character)) |>
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11, 
    names_to = "route_number", 
    values_to = "route_name", 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
    )
```

``` r
A_station=reformat_df|>filter(route_name == "A")|>distinct(line,station_name)
A_train_ada= reformat_df|>filter(route_name == "A"& ada=="TRUE")|>distinct(line,station_name)
```

- There are 60 distinct stations served the A train.
- There are 17 distinct A stations that are ADA compliant

## Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel Sheet: Load the excel using
`read_excel` and specify the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet and figure out some
potential NA cases. Then the `janitor::clean_names()` is used to
standardize the column names. The rows without dumspter specific data
are dropped the sports ball column is converted to the integer variable
using `as.integer`. In order to differentiate the trash wheel type and
help prepare the steps for combining, a column named trash_wheel is also
added. And the year is converted to integer as well.

The sheet Professor trash wheel and Gwynndan trash wheel are loaded and
cleaned similarly

``` r
#load the Mr. Trash sheet by specifying the excel file
Mr_trash_wheel_sheet=read_excel("data/Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx",
                                sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
                                na = c("NA", ".", "")) |>
   janitor::clean_names() |> #give reasonable name 
   select(dumpster:homes_powered)|>
   drop_na(dumpster)|> #remove the rows without dumpster specific data
   mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)),
          trash_wheel= "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
          year = as.integer(year))

Professor_trash_wheel_sheet=read_excel("data/Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx",
                                sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
                                na = c("NA", ".", "")) |>
   janitor::clean_names() |> #give reasonable name 
   select(dumpster:homes_powered)|>
   drop_na(dumpster) |> #remove the rows without dumpster specific data
   mutate(trash_wheel ="Professor trash wheel",
           year = as.integer(year))

Gwynnda_trash_wheel=read_excel("data/Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx",
                                sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
                                na = c("NA", ".", "")) |>
   janitor::clean_names() |> #give reasonable name 
   select(dumpster:homes_powered)|>
   drop_na(dumpster) |> #remove the rows without dumpster specific data
   mutate(trash_wheel ="Gwynnda trash wheel",
           year = as.integer(year))
```

- Mr. trash wheel sheet has 651 rows and 15 columns. With the variables:
  dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards,
  plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
  plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls, homes_powered, trash_wheel

- Professor trash wheel sheet has 119 rows and 14 columns. With the
  variables: dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons,
  volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
  glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers, homes_powered, trash_wheel

- Gwynnda trash wheel sheet has 263 rows and 13 columns. With the
  variables: dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons,
  volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
  plastic_bags, wrappers, homes_powered, trash_wheel

Then combine the dataset with `bind_rows` :

``` r
# Combine all three datasets into one tidy dataset
combined_trash_wheel_data <- bind_rows(Mr_trash_wheel_sheet, Professor_trash_wheel_sheet, Gwynnda_trash_wheel)
head(combined_trash_wheel_data,5)
## # A tibble: 5 × 15
##   dumpster month  year date                weight_tons volume_cubic_yards
##      <dbl> <chr> <int> <dttm>                    <dbl>              <dbl>
## 1        1 May    2014 2014-05-16 00:00:00        4.31                 18
## 2        2 May    2014 2014-05-16 00:00:00        2.74                 13
## 3        3 May    2014 2014-05-16 00:00:00        3.45                 15
## 4        4 May    2014 2014-05-17 00:00:00        3.1                  15
## 5        5 May    2014 2014-05-17 00:00:00        4.06                 18
## # ℹ 9 more variables: plastic_bottles <dbl>, polystyrene <dbl>,
## #   cigarette_butts <dbl>, glass_bottles <dbl>, plastic_bags <dbl>,
## #   wrappers <dbl>, sports_balls <int>, homes_powered <dbl>, trash_wheel <chr>
```

``` r
#filter by trash_wheel
weight_Professor=combined_trash_wheel_data |> 
  select(year,month,weight_tons,trash_wheel)|>
  filter(trash_wheel=="Professor trash wheel")

#filter by year and month for the Gwynnda trash wheel
cigg_gwy=combined_trash_wheel_data |> 
  select(year,month,cigarette_butts,trash_wheel)|>
  filter(trash_wheel=="Gwynnda trash wheel", year==2022, month=="June")
```

The new dataset has 1033 observations and 15 columns. With key
variables: dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards,
plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls, homes_powered, trash_wheel.

- The total trash weight collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 246.74
  tons.

- The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in June of
  2022 is 18120

## Problem 3

Import, clean and organize for viewers.csv The steps for cleaning
include figuring out the potential NA values and mutate the season
variable to integer. Then the data is organized using `pivot_longer`.

``` r
viewer=read_csv("data/gbb_datasets/viewers.csv",na = c("NA", ".", ""))|>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  pivot_longer(
    series_1:series_10,
    names_to="season",
    names_prefix="series_",
    values_to="viewers"
  )|> mutate(season=as.integer(season))
head(viewer,10)
## # A tibble: 10 × 3
##    episode season viewers
##      <dbl>  <int>   <dbl>
##  1       1      1    2.24
##  2       1      2    3.1 
##  3       1      3    3.85
##  4       1      4    6.6 
##  5       1      5    8.51
##  6       1      6   11.6 
##  7       1      7   13.6 
##  8       1      8    9.46
##  9       1      9    9.55
## 10       1     10    9.62
```

The average viewership in Season 1 is 2.77.

The average viewership in Season 5 is 10.04.
